# Java_Mini_project
hello guys, 

In this repo you are seeing my project on an ecomerce application, built on java. The basic outline of the ecommerce application is to provide a direct market access to farmers.

The project is built on java ant using multiple frameform integeration and using sql as the database.

the project is currently half built, as only the login page is connectedwith the proto type main page and the rest of the files product, productdao, productpanel are used for getting the product details on the main page which i am currently working on.

feel free to use this code and build on it, ping me on any querries or any ideas or suggestions you may build on from this.
